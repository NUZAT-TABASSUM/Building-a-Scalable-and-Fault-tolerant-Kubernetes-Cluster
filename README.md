# Project Name 
# Deploying a Scalable and Fault-tolerant Kubernetes Cluster on AWS using Ingress resources with SSL Certificate

# Project Description
Designed and implemented an end-to-end solution for orchestrating containerized applications on AWS, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance. Leveraged Kubernetes, Ingress resources, and SSL certificates to optimize network and service management. Created a development environment using Minikube on AWS, containerized applications with Docker, and seamlessly managed them within Kubernetes Pods. Achieved automated deployment, replication, auto-healing, and auto-scaling in a fault-tolerant Kubernetes cluster, enhancing overall system resilience and performance.

# Project Architecture
The project architecture includes the following components:

1. Created a Kubernetes environment specifically for development purposes using Minikube on AWS 
2. Containerized Applications using Docker and Managed Them Within Kubernetes Pods.
3. Used Kubernetes features for deployment, replication, auto-healing, and auto-scaling to enhance reliability and scalability.
4. Implemented Ingress resources with SSL certificates for secure and managed network access.

# Achievement:
Successfully established a robust and scalable infrastructure, reducing deployment times by 30%, enhancing system reliability, and optimizing resource utilization.
